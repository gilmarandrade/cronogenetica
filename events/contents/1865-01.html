        <h1>Gregor Mendel e as Leis da Hereditariedade</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
        <p>Gregor Mendel describes his experiments with peas showing that heredity is transmitted in discrete units.</p>
        <p>From earliest time, people noticed the resemblance between parents and offspring, among animals and plants as well as in human families. Gregor Johann Mendel turned the study of heredity into a science.</p>
        <p>Mendel was a monk in the Augustinian order, long interested in botany. He studied mathematics and science at the University of Vienna to become a science teacher. For eight years, starting in 1857, he studied the peas he grew in the garden of his monastery. He carefully pollinated the plants, saved seeds to plant separately, and analyzed the succeeding generations.</p>
        <p>He self-pollinated plants until they bred true - giving rise to similar characteristics generation after generation. He studied easily distinguishable characteristics like the color and texture of the peas, the color of the pea pods and flowers, and the height of the plants.</p>
        <p>When he crossed true-breeding lines with each other, he noticed that the characteristics of the offspring consistently showed a three to one ratio in the second generation. For example, for approximately every three tall plants, one would be short; for about every three plants with yellow peas, one would have green peas. Further breeding showed that some traits are dominant (like tall or yellow) and others recessive (like short or green). In other words, some traits can mask others. But the traits don't blend: they are inherited from the parents as discrete units and remain distinct. Furthermore, different traits - like height and seed color - are inherited independently of each other.</p>
    
        <p>
            Mendel's work showed that:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Each parent contributes one factor of each trait shown in offspring</li>
            <li>The two members of each pair of factors segregate from each other during gamete formation</li>
            <li>The blending theory of inheritance was not correct</li>
            <li>Males and females contribute equally to the traits in their offspring</li>
            <li>Acquired traits are not inherited. Mendel had referred to the genes as 'particles of inheritance'</li>
        </ol>
